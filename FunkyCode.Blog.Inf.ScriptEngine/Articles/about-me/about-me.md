My name is Maciej Szczudło. I am a professional software developer and occasionally solution architect. I am working at Ericsson in Cracow. 
This blog, its content and opinions are my own. I have just started… 
So far comments are turned off, I am not ready for them yet. 
I am also on  LinkedIn and Facebook.
